# ase-bimetall
The collection of my scripts for Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE). Mostly concerned bimetallic nanoparticles.


*analyzecn.py* -- procedure-driven calculation of coordination numbers and similar quantities.

*coreshell.py* -- procedures to build atomic clusters with particular architecture

*mc_search.py* -- Monte-Carlo search of structures with predicted coordination numbers. Based on code from ASAP project (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/asap/Monte%20Carlo%20simulations)

*qsar.py* -- class for calculation of coordination numbers and similar quantities
